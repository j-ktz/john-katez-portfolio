# John Katez Portfolio (Static Site)

This version keeps **all HTML files in the repo root** so GitHub Pages + relative paths are dead simple.
CSS lives at `assets/css/styles.css`.

## Resume
Included at `assets/files/John_Katez_Master_Resume.pdf`.

## Publish
Upload the contents of this folder to your repo root, then GitHub Pages will serve it.
